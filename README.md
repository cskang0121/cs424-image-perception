## CS424 Image Perception

This repository contains my solutions for a course in image perception and recognition. When we see a table, we vividly perceive it as an object in the class of tables.  However, computers only see a bunch of pixels. Image perception is the task of getting computers to see in a human like manner. To achieve this, researchers have pooled techniques and results from a large variety of different fields.

#### Course Outline :

This course introduces the mathematical tools and concepts underlying image perception. These include deep learning, linear algebra, statistics and multi-view geometry. The goal is to get students comfortable with utilizing and interpreting the results of state-of-art machine learning techniques. At the end of the course, students should be aware of what can be achieved by current visual perception techniques, how to achieve it and what the limitations of these techniques are.
